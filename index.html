               <p>Rice is the most important food crop of India covering about one-fourth of the total cropped area and providing food to about half of the Indian population. Punjab has made tremendous progress in rice productivity and production during the past 45 years. Due to use of high yielding varieties and new technology Punjab has given the title of "Rice Bowl of India".The traditional method of rice cultivation is to water the fields at the time of planting the young seedling, or later.
