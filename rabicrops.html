               <p>Wheat (scientific name: Triticum aestivum), is the world's major food grain crop, which is cultivated throughout the world. Worldwide, wheat is the second most cultivated food crop after maize, with rice coming in third, just behind wheat. Scientifically, wheat is a plant of the grass family and is native to the Levant region of the Middle East.India is the second largest producer of wheat after China.Wheat (Triticum sp.) is a crop of worldwide importance. This crop is grown in diverse environments. It is the staple food of millions. Wheat is cultivated on about one-sixth of the total cultivated land in the world. Although rice is mainly cultivated in Asia, wheat is grown in all the peninsulas of the world.
                Deep plowing should be done to make the soil of the field fine and friable. The soil should be leveled by plowing with disc harrow before paret (irrigation) done before sowing. 25 km before sowing. Gram. 10 per hectare b. H. C. By mixing, the crop can be saved from the attack of termites and gujai. If there is no moisture in the field before sowing, irrigation is necessary for uniform germination.

                <p>Mustard is a dicotyledonous, annual herbaceous plant of the Cruciferae (Brassicaceae) family. Its scientific name is Brassica compressitis.Oil is extracted from mustard seeds, which is used in making various types of food items and applying it to the body. Its oil is used to make pickles, soap and glycerol. The oil obtained after extraction of oil is used to feed cattle. Cake is also used as a fertilizerMustard is the second most important oilseed crop in India after groundnut, which is mainly grown in Rajasthan, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa, West Bengal and Assam Gujarat. Mustard cultivation is becoming very popular for the farmers because it is getting more benefits than other crops with less irrigation and cost.Flat and well-drained sandy loam to loam soil is suitable for good mustard production, but it should be free from salinity and alkalinity. It can also be cultivated by selecting suitable varieties from alkaline soil.

Barley can be cultivated up to an altitude of 4000 meters above sea level. Cold and moist climate is suitable for barley cultivation. The minimum temperature for barley crop is 35-40°F, the highest temperature is 72-86°F and the optimum temperature is 70°F.Sowing should be done after plowing in the months of November and December. While sowing, the farmer brothers have to keep in mind that the distance from line to line should be one to one and a half feet. 100 kg of barley seed is required for sowing per hectare. Farmer brothers have to be careful if sowing is delayed. The quantity of seed has to be increased by 25 percent and the distance from row to row has to be kept more.

               <p>The beetroot is the taproot portion of a beet plant, usually known in North America as beets while the vegetable is referred to as beetroot in British English, and also known as the table beet, garden beet, red beet, dinner beet or golden beet.It is one of several cultivated varieties of Beta vulgaris grown for their edible taproots and leaves (called beet greens); they have been classified as B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris Conditiva Group.he domestication of beetroot can be traced to the emergence of an allele, which enables biennial harvesting of leaves and taproot.[6] Beetroot was domesticated in the ancient Middle East, primarily for their greens, and were grown by the Ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans. By the Roman era, it is thought that they were also cultivated for their roots. From the Middle Ages, beetroot was used to treat various conditions, especially illnesses relating to digestion and the blood. Bartolomeo Platina recommended taking beetroot with garlic to nullify the effects of "garlic-breath"

                <h1>sunflower</h1>
                <p>Helianthus is a genus comprising about 70 species of annual and perennial flowering plants in the daisy family Asteraceae commonly known as sunflowers. Except for three South American species, the species of Helianthus are native to North America and Central America. The best-known species is the common sunflower (Helianthus annuus).Sunflowers are usually tall annual or perennial plants that in some species can grow to a height of 300 centimetres (120 inches) or more. Each "flower" is actually a disc made up of tiny flowers, to form a larger false flower to better attract pollinators.The petiolate leaves are dentate and often sticky. The lower leaves are opposite, ovate, or often heart-shaped. The rough and hairy stem is branched in the upper part in wild plants, but is usually unbranched in domesticated cultivars.The growth of a sunflower depends strictly on its genetic makeup and background. Additionally, the season it is planted will have effects on its development; those seasons tend to be in the middle of summer and beginning of fall. Sunflower development is classified by a series of vegetative stages and reproductive stages that can be determined by identifying the heads or main branch of a single head or branched head.</p>
